**Fill in the blanks in the following table using the information you gathered about the cache configuration of the lab machine.**

| Cache | Cache Line Size | Total Size | Associativity | Number of Sets | Raw Latency |
| ----- | --------------- | ---------- | ------------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| L1-D  | 64              |            |               |                |             |

**After completing your code, generate the histogram pdf file and include it in the lab report.**

<!-- ![Histogram](./Part1-Timing/Histogram.pdf) -->

## 1-4

**Based on the generated histogram, report two thresholds, one to distinguish between L2 and L3 latency and the other to distinguish between L3 and DRAM latency.**

L2-L3 threshold:

L3-DRAM threshold:

**In the victim's pseudocode above, the victim attempts to load the data indexed by `flag` into the `value` variable. How can you change the victim's code to load the desired data without leaking the flag to the attacker?**
